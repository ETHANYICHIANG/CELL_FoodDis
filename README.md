# CELL_FoodDis

INPUTS:
Species, population, dominance rating
If they can access it and if they want to eat the food in question
The different food sources, and the food output of that source (given from the food-environment system)

Does each species reach a max of how much they eat of each plant? 
Is there a way for a species to over-eat and kill the plant??

Can they access it?
Consider:
	-reach
	-fear of predators factor
	-fences
The user puts down fences to separate areas, so accessibility could be difficult to calculate.

If we are given the pertinent animals in the area, this should be easy to calculate.

We still need to look at the code already in place!

What language/document should this code be in?
